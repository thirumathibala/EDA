Problem Statement
	Marketing to Frequent Fliers. The file EastWestAirlinesCluster.xls 
(Available on the textbook website http://dataminingbook.com/)  
- Contains information on 4000 passengers who belong to an airline’s frequent flier program. For each passenger the data include information on their mileage history and on different ways they accrued or spent miles in the last year.
The goal is to try to identify clusters of passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers.
a) Apply hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and Ward’s method. Make sure to standardize the data first. How many clusters appear?
b) What would happen if the data were not standardized?
c) Compare the cluster centroids to characterize the different clusters and try to give each cluster a label.
d) To check the stability of the clusters, remove a random 5% of the data (by taking a random sample of 95% of the records), and repeat the analysis. Does the same picture emerge?
e) Use k-means clustering with the number of clusters that you found above in Part(a). Does the same picture emerge? If not, how does it contrast or validate the finding in Part c above?
f) Which cluster(s) would you target for offers, and what type of offers would you target to customers in that cluster? Include proper reasoning in support of your choice of cluster(s) and the corresponding offer(s).
